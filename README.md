# project_uplift
A website to help people volunteer at nursing homes

This README will serve as more of a planning document for the time being. I want to build this site with Angular, Go and Node
on top of a MySQL database. 

The database will be hosted on AWS.

The site will initially be found as a subdirectory of jzpeterson.com because I already own that domain name.
